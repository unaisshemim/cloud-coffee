## Skill Loading

Before editing files for a substantial task:
- Run `pnpm dlx @tanstack/intent@latest list` from the workspace root to see available local skills.
- If a listed skill matches the task, run `pnpm dlx @tanstack/intent@latest load <package>#<skill>` before changing files.
- Use the loaded `SKILL.md` guidance while making the change.
- Monorepos: when working across packages, run the skill check from the workspace root and prefer the local skill for the package being changed.
- Multiple matches: prefer the most specific local skill for the package or concern you are changing; load additional skills only when the task spans multiple packages or concerns.

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

When the user types `/graphify`, use the installed graphify skill or instructions before doing anything else.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- Dirty graphify-out/ files are expected after hooks or incremental updates; dirty graph files are not a reason to skip graphify. Only skip graphify if the task is about stale or incorrect graph output, or the user explicitly says not to use it.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues and specs are tracked in GitHub Issues for `amruthpillai/reactive-resume`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Domain docs

This repository uses a multi-context domain-doc layout. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

### Overview

Reactive Resume is a pnpm monorepo (Turborepo) with two deployable apps: `apps/web` (TanStack Start / React 19 / Vite) and `apps/server` (Hono / Node.js). The production Docker image runs a single Node.js process on port 3000, with `apps/server` mounting the API/auth/MCP/static routes and serving the built web app.

Internal packages are source-consumed through `package.json` export maps that point at `src` files. Do not assume package-local `dist` output exists unless a package explicitly adds it.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 24** (matches Dockerfile `ARG NODE_VERSION=24`). Use `nvm install 24 && nvm use 24` if needed.
- **Docker** is required to run PostgreSQL. Start it with `sudo dockerd &` if the daemon isn't running.
- **pnpm 11.21.0**. Install pnpm directly using the [official installation guide](https://pnpm.io/installation).

### Codebase map

- `apps/web` owns TanStack Start routes, Vite config, PWA setup, oRPC browser client wiring, web features, and the resume builder UI.
- `apps/server` owns the production Hono app, route composition, auth/RPC/MCP/OpenAPI handlers, static uploads, schema JSON, web-dist fallback serving, and startup checks.
- `packages/api` contains oRPC routers, DTOs, rate limiting, and feature-owned API modules under `packages/api/src/features/*`. The router export at `@reactive-resume/api/routers` aggregates those feature routers for `/api/rpc`.
- `packages/auth` contains Better Auth config, auth helper functions, and exported auth types. The server auth adapter in `apps/server/src/http/auth.ts` delegates to `auth.handler`.
- `packages/db` contains the Drizzle client and schema. Migration files live at the repo root in `migrations/`.
- `packages/env` defines server environment validation and auto-loads the root `.env` for app/server code.
- `packages/schema` contains Zod schemas and typed resume/page/template models.
- `packages/pdf` contains the React PDF document, font registration, shared template primitives, template implementations, and browser/server PDF generation adapters. PDF.js viewer UI stays in `apps/web`.
- `packages/resume` contains pure resume-domain behavior such as JSON Patch helpers and social-network icon mapping.
- `packages/docx` contains DOCX export generation.
- `packages/mcp` contains MCP tools, prompts, resources, server-card generation, and tool metadata.
- `packages/ui` contains shared Base UI/shadcn-style components and hooks.
- `packages/fonts`, `packages/email`, `packages/import`, `packages/ai`, `packages/utils`, and `packages/config` provide focused support surfaces. Prefer their existing exports over adding cross-package shortcuts.
- Development-only scripts live in `tooling/`, not under `packages/`, so packages only contain code bundled by the app/runtime.

### Web app conventions

- Routes are file-based under `apps/web/src/routes`. Do not hand-edit `apps/web/src/routeTree.gen.ts`; it is generated by TanStack Router tooling.
- Server-owned HTTP behavior lives in `apps/server/src/{http,rpc,mcp,openapi,static,startup}`. Keep API/RPC/auth/MCP/static route wiring in `apps/server`, not in web routes.
- `apps/web/src/router.tsx` initializes router context with `queryClient`, `orpc`, `theme`, `locale`, `session`, and `flags`. Reuse route context where possible instead of refetching these concerns ad hoc.
- The builder shell lives under `apps/web/src/routes/builder/$resumeId`. The nested preview route is client-only (`ssr: false`), while the public resume route `apps/web/src/routes/$username/$slug.tsx` uses `ssr: "data-only"`.
- Browser-only resume preview code lives under `apps/web/src/features/resume/preview`, and public resume PDF viewer code lives under `apps/web/src/features/resume/public`. Keep PDF.js/canvas/browser APIs out of SSR paths and out of `packages/pdf`.
- The isomorphic oRPC client is in `apps/web/src/libs/orpc/client.ts`; server calls use an in-process router client and browser calls use `/api/rpc` with credentials included.
- For React components with explicit props, prefer a named TypeScript props type over inline object annotations in the function signature, especially once the props include more than one field or generics. For example:

```ts
type IntentSelectFieldProps<TValue extends string> = {
	label: string;
	id: string;
	value: TValue | undefined;
	options: readonly ComboboxOption<TValue>[];
	onChange: (value: TValue | undefined) => void;
};

function IntentSelectField<TValue extends string>(props: IntentSelectFieldProps<TValue>) {
	// ...
}
```

### Package and feature boundaries

- Workspace dependencies must go through package names and package export maps. Do not import another workspace's `src` tree through repository paths, `@reactive-resume/*/src/*`, or TypeScript path aliases.
- `turbo boundaries` is the executable package-boundary check. Workspace-level `turbo.json` files declare coarse tags:
  - `app:web` for the TanStack Start app.
  - `app:server` and `runtime:server` for the Node/Hono process.
  - `runtime:server` for server-only packages such as API/auth/db/env/email/MCP.
  - `runtime:browser` for browser-only shared UI.
  - `runtime:universal` for environment-neutral domain packages.
  - `role:domain`, `role:infra`, `role:adapter`, `role:api`, `role:rendering`, and `role:tooling` for package intent.
- Browser/server runtime-specific code should live behind explicit export subpaths such as `@reactive-resume/pdf/browser`, `@reactive-resume/pdf/server`, or `@reactive-resume/env/server`. Keep root exports environment-neutral unless the package is intentionally server-only.
- Wildcard exports are allowed only for leaf libraries whose public surface is intentionally file-like, currently `@reactive-resume/ui/components/*`, `@reactive-resume/ui/hooks/*`, and schema resume model files. Prefer explicit exports for packages that own runtime behavior.
- Add new API procedures and business logic inside the owning `packages/api/src/features/*` module. Keep route wiring, DTO usage, helpers, and services colocated by feature/capability, then expose only intentional public surfaces through `packages/api/package.json`. Prefer `protectedProcedure` from `packages/api/src/context.ts` for authenticated procedures.
- Add database columns/tables in `packages/db/src/schema/*`, then generate root-level migrations with `dotenvx run -f .env.local -- pnpm db:generate`.
- Add or change resume data shape in `packages/schema/src/resume/*` first, then update API DTOs, importers, PDF rendering, and web forms that consume that shape.
- Add or rename templates in all relevant places: `packages/schema/src/templates.ts`, `packages/pdf/src/templates/index.ts`, template source under `packages/pdf/src/templates/<name>/`, and static previews under `apps/web/public/templates/{jpg,pdf}`.
- Resume JSON Patch behavior belongs in `@reactive-resume/resume/patch`; do not put resume-domain helpers in `@reactive-resume/utils`.
- DOCX export behavior belongs in `@reactive-resume/docx`; do not put DOCX builders in `@reactive-resume/utils`.
- Shared PDF section filtering lives in `packages/pdf/src/templates/shared/filtering.ts`. Keep template-specific visual exceptions in the owning template directory unless multiple templates need the same behavior.
- `packages/pdf/src/hooks/use-register-fonts.ts` owns React PDF font registration, standard PDF font handling, CJK fallback stacks, and global hyphenation behavior.
- PDF generation helpers live behind `@reactive-resume/pdf/browser` and `@reactive-resume/pdf/server`; locale-specific section-title resolution stays in the caller.
- MCP implementation belongs in `@reactive-resume/mcp`; app packages must not import MCP implementation from another app's source tree.
- `packages/utils` has narrowly exported helpers. If another package needs a utility, add an explicit export path instead of importing private files.

Placement decision tree:

1. If the change is a web route, route loader, or user-facing web workflow, start in `apps/web/src/routes` or `apps/web/src/features`.
2. If the change is a server HTTP route/adapter, startup check, static handler, MCP transport, or OpenAPI/well-known handler, start in `apps/server/src`.
3. If it is authenticated API behavior, put the contract and implementation in the owning `packages/api/src/features/*` module.
4. If it is pure resume data behavior with no DB, HTTP, DOM, or PDF renderer dependency, put it in `packages/resume`.
5. If it renders resume PDFs, put shared React PDF/template code in `packages/pdf`; put PDF.js viewer/canvas UI in `apps/web/src/features/resume`.
6. If it creates DOCX exports, put it in `packages/docx`.
7. If it exposes MCP tools/prompts/resources, put it in `packages/mcp`.
8. If it is a generic UI primitive or hook, put it in `packages/ui`; if it is workflow-specific UI, keep it in the owning web feature.
9. If it is a narrow cross-cutting helper, add an explicit `packages/utils` export only after checking that no domain package is a better owner.

### Database

PostgreSQL runs via Docker Compose:

```
sudo docker compose -f compose.dev.yml up -d postgres
```

The dev default connection string is `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres`.

**Important**: `drizzle-kit` (used by `pnpm db:migrate`) reads `DATABASE_URL` from `process.env` directly — it does **not** auto-load the `.env` file. Run migration commands through `dotenvx`, for example `dotenvx run -f .env.local -- pnpm db:migrate`, so `DATABASE_URL` is present in the process environment.

The production server runs migrations during startup before serving traffic. Manual `pnpm db:migrate` is mainly for first setup, migration debugging, or applying migrations without starting the app.

### Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`. The three required variables are:

- `APP_URL` (default `http://localhost:3000`)
- `DATABASE_URL` (default `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres`)
- `AUTH_SECRET` (any non-empty string)

S3/SeaweedFS is optional. If `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `S3_BUCKET` are all set, the app uses S3-compatible storage. The checked-in `.env.example` sets SeaweedFS defaults, so either start the `seaweedfs` compose service too or comment out those S3 vars to use local filesystem storage under `<workspace>/data`. `LOCAL_STORAGE_PATH` must be absolute when set.

`REDIS_URL` and `ENCRYPTION_SECRET` are optional for core resume flows, but both are required for saved AI providers and the authenticated `/agent` workspace. Start the `redis` compose service and set both vars in `.env.local` when working on those features. For host-run development, use `REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379`; the container-run app uses `REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379`.

When running dev servers or migration commands, prefix the command with `dotenvx run -f .env.local --`. For example: `dotenvx run -f .env.local -- pnpm dev`. Tests, typechecks, linters, boundary checks, and `pnpm build` do not need this prefix by default. If one of those commands fails because a specific environment variable is required, rerun it with the `dotenvx run -f .env.local --` prefix.

### Common commands

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Install deps | `pnpm install` |
| Start Postgres only | `sudo docker compose -f compose.dev.yml up -d postgres` |
| Start Postgres + SeaweedFS | `sudo docker compose -f compose.dev.yml up -d postgres seaweedfs seaweedfs_create_bucket` |
| Start full dev infrastructure | `sudo docker compose -f compose.dev.yml up -d postgres redis seaweedfs seaweedfs_create_bucket` |
| Generate migrations | `dotenvx run -f .env.local -- pnpm db:generate` |
| Run migrations | `dotenvx run -f .env.local -- pnpm db:migrate` |
| Dev server | `dotenvx run -f .env.local -- pnpm dev` (starts on port 3000) |
| Web dev server only | `dotenvx run -f .env.local -- pnpm dev:web` |
| Lint/format | `pnpm check` (Biome) |
| Boundary check | `pnpm exec turbo boundaries` |
| Tests | `pnpm test` (Vitest) |
| Build | `pnpm build` |
| Typecheck | `pnpm typecheck` |

For focused validation, prefer package filters before repo-wide commands, for example:

```
pnpm --filter web typecheck
pnpm --filter @reactive-resume/pdf test
pnpm --filter @reactive-resume/api test
pnpm exec turbo boundaries
```

Vitest test paths are package-relative when running through `pnpm --filter <package> test -- <path>`.

### Gotchas

- The server startup path auto-runs migrations before serving traffic, so `pnpm db:migrate` is mainly needed for first-time setup, migration debugging, or applying migrations without starting the app.
- Email sending requires SMTP config; without it, emails are logged to console. This is fine for dev — the app still functions, but email verification links appear in server logs.
- The `lefthook.yml` pre-commit hook runs `biome check` on staged files. Run `pnpm check` before committing to avoid hook failures.
- `pnpm check` is write-capable (`biome check --write --unsafe .`). Call that out when using it, and use narrower Biome commands if you need a non-mutating inspection.
- Biome uses tabs, double quotes, line width 120, organized import groups, and sorted Tailwind classes for `clsx`, `cva`, and `cn`.
- Most packages use `tsgo --noEmit` for typechecking and `vitest run --passWithNoTests` for tests.
- There may be unrelated local edits in the worktree. Inspect `git status --short` first and avoid reverting files you did not touch.
- **New env vars require a `turbo.json` entry.** Turborepo 2.x runs in strict env mode by default — it filters out env vars that are not listed in `globalEnv` (or task-level `env`/`passThroughEnv`). Any new environment variable added to `packages/env/src/server.ts` must also be added to the `globalEnv` array in `turbo.json`, or the variable will be `undefined` inside child processes at runtime even if it is correctly set in the OS/container environment.
